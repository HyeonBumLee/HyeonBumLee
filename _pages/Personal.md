About me without research

**_Marathoner_**

I am an amateur marathoner. I have completed three full courses of the marathon in Chuncheon, Gunsan, and Seoul, Korea. As a marathoner, I hope to achieve the following: 

1. Achieving **_Sub3_** (Complete full-marathon in less than 3 hours)
2. Participating in the World Major Marathons: Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago, New York, etc...
3. Participating in a marathon with family (future wife, future children, etc...)

This is my personal best time:

10K - 42:08 (Gunsan, 2024)\
Half - 1:36:25 (Seoul, 2023)\
Full - 3:19:59 (Seoul, 2024)
